                </h3>
                Alternative finance—in all its myriad forms—could prove the answer to the global trade finance gap. Trade finance plays an
                important role in supporting global trade: As well as providing funding, it also enables importers and exporters to
                mitigate risk in their transactions. However, in some parts of the world, demand significantly outstrips availability
                for such funding. As a result, more companies are turning to alternative financiers to meet their trade finance needs.

                  Tech And The Future Of Trade Finance
                </h3>
                Blockchain, the Cloud and the Internet of Things are luring trade finance away from its reliance on paper. Trade finance
                is one area of commercial banking that historically has proven resistant to technological innovations. “It’s both ancient
                and arcane,” says Andy Schmidt, executive adviser with consulting firm CEB. As a niche within commercial banking, trade
                finance hasn’t seen the same pressure to modernize as have higher-volume areas like payments, he adds. To read more,

                  Top Innovators In Trade Finance | 2016
                </h3>
                Trade finance is behind some other banking sectors in transitioning to paperless documents and digital distribution, but
                it’s catching up. This may be the age of fintech (financial technology), but the world of trade often bears better
                comparison with the Dark Ages than the digital age. Phones, faxes and paper—not computer nodes and e-documents—are
                still the order of the day. But if our Innovators in Trade Finance are anything to go by, that is all about to change.

                  In Developing Technology, Banks Go Back To Basics
                </h3>
                Amid the surge in global trade, financial institutions are revisiting the way they conduct transaction banking. Technological
                innovations like distributed ledgers may be rocketing financial institutions into the future. But Lisa Robins, a managing
                director and the regional head of global transaction banking, Asia-Pacific, at Deutsche Bank, says the renewed attention
                the industry is paying to transaction banking “is taking us back to our origins—focusing specifically on the needs
                of customers and organizing to meet those needs.” To read more, Please visit:

						<b>Blockchain Technology</b>
						<br/>
						<br/> A blockchain is a type of distributed ledger, comprised of unchangeable, digitally recorded data in packages called blocks. These digitally recorded "blocks" of data is stored in a linear chain. Each block in the chain contains data (e.g. bitcoin
						transaction), is cryptographically hashed. The blocks of hashed data draw upon the previous-block (which came before it) in the chain, ensuring all data in the overall "blockchain" has not been tampered with and remains unchanged

                <h4><b>BaaS</b></h4>
                <p>A relatively new term for 2016, coined by William Mougayar of Virtual Capital Ventures in early 2015. It means Blockchain-as-a-Service. Equivalent terms include Ethereum Blockchain-as-a-Service (EthBaaS), or “Blockchain-as-a-Platform” (BaaP). It refers to the growing landscape of services based around blockchain technology. The best example of this we have so far is Microsoft launching its own EthBaaS on the Microsoft Azure cloud platform this year. This platform will allow companies to begin working with blockchain technology without having to first make significant investments in hardware.</p>

                <h4><b>Beneficiary</b></h4>
                <p>The person (for example, the exporter) in whose favour the credit is issued.</p>

                <h4><b>Bid Bond</b></h4>
                <p>A bond provided by a bank to the buyer promising compensation, usually on demand, in the event that a supplier declines to enter into a contract in conformity with the bid he has put forward.</p>

                <h4><b>Bill Of Exchange</b></h4>
                <p>An unconditional order in writing addressed by one person to another, signed by the person creating it (drawer), and requiring the addressee (drawee) to pay a certain sum of money to the drawer at a fixed or determinable future time .</p>

                <h4><b>Bill Of Lading</b></h4>
                <p>Issued by a shipping company to the shipper as a receipt for the goods, a memorandum of the contract of carriage and a document of title.</p>

                <h4><b>Bitcoin (uppercase)</b></h4>
                <p>The well known cryptocurrency, based on the proof-of-work blockchain.<br />
                </p>

                <h4><b>bitcoin (lowercase)</b></h4>
                <p>The specific collection of technologies used by Bitcoin’s ledger, a particular solution. Note that the currency is
                  itself one of these technologies, as it provides the miners with the incentive to mine. <br />
                </p>

                <h4><b>Bitcoin Mining</b></h4>
                <p>Bitcoin mining is the process by which transactions are verified and added to the public ledger, known as the block chain, and also the means through which new bitcoin are released.  Anyone with access to the internet and suitable hardware can participate in mining.  The mining process involves compiling recent transactions into blocks and trying to solve a computationally difficult puzzle.  The participant who first solves the puzzle gets to place the next block on the block chain and claim the rewards.  The rewards, which incentivize mining, are both the transaction fees associated with the transactions compiled in the block as well as newly released bitcoin.<br />
                </p>

                <h4><b>Block</b></h4>
                <p>A block refers to a large order of the same security to be bought or sold by institutional or other large investors. There is no official size designation constituting a block of securities, but a commonly used threshold is more than 10,000 equity shares, or a total market value of more than $200,000.<br />
                </p>

                <h4><b>Blocked Fund Letters (BFL)</b></h4>
                <p>In cases where a fraudster has enticed an investor into a bogus scheme where the invested funds remain on deposit earning interest in the investor’s bank, the investor is told to obtain a blocked fund letter (BFL) from his bank. This letter promises to pay funds from the victim’s account to the holder of the letter. The fraudster, often with the help of a third party such as a lawyer, obtains control of the BFL which he uses as collateral to get a loan at a bank of his choice. The fraudster can then default on the loan and flee. Under the BFL the issuing bank must pay the lending bank and the victim loses his money. However, the banking community does not recognISe BFLs as banking instruments and they should not be issued by banks or accepted as collateral.<br />
                </p>

                <h4><b>Blockchain</b></h4>
                <p>A blockchain is a type of distributed ledger, comprised of unchangable, digitally recorded data in
                  packages called blocks (rather like collating them on to a single sheet of paper). Each block is then ‘chained’ to
                  the next block, using a cryptographic signature. This allows block chains to be used like a ledger, which can be
                  shared and accessed by anyone with the appropriate permissions.<br />
                </p>

                <h4><b>Block Height</b></h4>
                <p>Block height refers to the number of blocks connected together in the block chain. For example, <i>Height 0</i>, would
                  be the very first block, which is also called the <i>Genesis Block</i>.<br />
                </p>

                <h4><b>Block House</b></h4>
                <p>A brokerage firm with the primary focus of locating potential buyers and sellers of large trades. A block house typically deals with institutional clients rather than individual investors, since each transaction represents millions of dollars. Examples of institutional clients include mutual funds and pension funds that assume significant security positions. Because of the nature of block house firms, their trading activity can have a considerable effect on the financial markets. Block trades are generally considered to be those dealing with more than 10,000 shares of stock (excluding penny stocks), or any other trade that involves a high monetary value.<br/>
                </p>

                <h4><b>Block Positioner</b></h4>
                <p>A securities dealer who will take a long or short position in order to accommodate a seller or buyer of a large block of securities. The dealer takes on the risk of the securities in order to help clear the trade for the seller. Block positioners aim to unload the position quickly, and typically hedge their risk with options or by selling the securities short.<br/>
                </p>

                <h4><b>Block Reward</b></h4>
                <p>The reward given to a miner which has successfully hashed a transaction block. Block rewards can be a mixture of coins
                  and transaction fees, depending on the policy used by the cryptocurrency in question, and whether all of the coins
                  have already been successfully mined. The current block reward for the Bitcoin network is 25 bitcoins for each block.<br/>
                </p>

                <h4><b>Block Trade</b></h4>
                <p>A block trade, also known as a block order, is an order or trade submitted for the sale or purchase of a large quantity of securities. A block trade involves a significantly large number of equities or bonds being traded at an arranged price between two parties, sometimes outside of the open markets, to lessen the impact on the security price. In general, 10,000 shares of stock, not including penny stocks, or $200,000 worth of bonds are considered a block trade.<br/>
                </p>

                <h4><b>Block Trading Facility - BTF</b></h4>
                <p>A wholesale trading facility that allows traders to buy or sell large numbers of securities bilaterally outside of the public market. Because trades conducted in a block trading facility are typically between two parties, prices are set with certainty and execution is done without delay. Institutional investors use block trading facilities for transactions involving large numbers of shares.<br/>
                </p>

                <h4><b>Buyer Credit</b></h4>
                <p>A financing arrangement under which a lending bank in the supplier’s country lends directly to the buyer or to a bank in the buyer’s country to enable the buyer to make payments due to the supplier under a contract.<br/>

                <h4><b>Coinjoin</b></h4>
                <p>An anonymization strategy that protects the privacy of Bitcoin users when they conduct transactions with each other. Coinjoin requires multiple parties to jointly sign on an agreement to mix their coins when engaging in separate Bitcoin transactions.<br />
                </p>

                <h4><b>Collecting Bank</b></h4>
                <p>The bank in the buyer’s (drawee’s) country to whom the collection order and documents are directed.<br />

                <h4><b>Commercial Letter of Credit</b></h4>
                <p>A name sometimes given to a variant of documentary credit under which the credit is negotiable by any bank. The issuing bank requires all drawings to be noted on the credit document.<br />
                </p>

                <h4><b>Confirmation</b></h4>
                <p>A confirmation means that the blockchain transaction has been verified by the network. This happens through a process
                  known as mining, in a proof-of-work system (e.g. Bitcoin). Once a transaction is <i>confirmed</i>, it cannot be reversed
                  or double spent. The more confirmations a transaction has, the harder it becomes to perform a double spend attack.<br
                  />
                </p>

                <h4><b>Confirming Bank</b></h4>
                <p>A bank which adds its own independent payment undertaking to that of the issuing bank. The confirming bank is normally in the beneficiary’s country. The confirmation protects the beneficiary against the issuing bank defaulting, and political risk with regard to the country in which the issuing bank is situated.<br />
                </p>

                <h4><b>Consensus Process</b></h4>
                <p>The process a group of peers responsible for maintaining a distributed ledger use to reach consensus on the ledger’s
                  contents. <br />
                </p>

                <h4><b>Consensus Point</b></h4>
                <p>A point – either in time, or defined in terms of a set number or volume of records to be added to the ledger – where
                  peers meet to agree the state of the ledger.<br />
                </p>

                <h4><b>Crowdfunding</b></h4>
                <p>There are two types of crowdfunding: rewards-based crowdfunding and equity-based crowdfunding. The first relates to platforms like Kickstarter or Indiegogo, where startups raise pledges and in return offer buy-in incentives for anything they produce. Equity crowdfunding is a more recent phenomenon where pledgers are actually investors that receive a small share in the business in return for their contributions.</p>

                <h4><b>Cryptocurrency</b></h4>
                <p>A form of digital currency based on mathematics, where encryption techniques are used to regulate the generation of

It refers to the hosting of physical or virtual servers by a third party as a security measure to protect a business’ infrastructure in case of a cyber attack, natural disaster, or man-made catastrophe.</p>

                <h4><b>Distributed Ledger</b></h4>
                <p>Distributed ledgers are a type of database that are spread across multiple sites, countries or institutions. Records
                  are stored one after the other in a continuous ledger. Distributed ledger data can be either "permissioned" or "unpermissioned"
                  to control who can view it. <br />
                </p>

                <h4><b>Difficulty</b></h4>
                <p>Difficulty, in Proof-of-Work mining, is how hard it is to verify blocks in a blockchain network. In the Bitcoin network,
                  the difficulty of mining adjusts verifying blocks every 2016 blocks. This is to keep block verification time at ten
                  minutes.<br />
                </p>

                <h4><b>Double Spend</b></h4>
                <p>Double spend refers to a scenario, in the Bitcoin network, where someone tries to send a bitcoin transaction to two
                  different recipients at the same time. However, once a bitcoin transaction is confirmed, it makes it nearly impossible
                  to double spend it. The more confirmations that a particular transaction has, the harder it becomes to double spend
                  the bitcoins.<br />
                </p>

                <h4><b>Digital Copy</b></h4>
                <p>A duplicate record of every confirmed Bitcoin transaction that has taken place over a peer-to-peer network. Digital copy is one of the security features of the Bitcoin platform that was implemented in order to tackle the problem of double spending.<br />
                </p>

                <h4><b>Distribution Stock</b></h4>
                <p>Distribution stock refers to a large block of a security which is sold into the market gradually in smaller blocks rather than in a single large block. This is typically done to avoid inundating the market with the security and driving down the average selling price of the securities.<br />

                <h4><b>Mining</b></h4>
                <p>The process by which transactions are verified and added to a blockchain. This process of solving cryptographic problems
                  using computing hardware also triggers the release of cryptocurrencies. <br />
                </p>

                <h4><b>Multi Signature</b></h4>
                <p>Multi-signature (<i>multisig</i>) addresses allow multiple parties to require more than one key to authorize a transaction.
                  The needed number of signatures is agreed at the creation of the address. Multi signature addresses have a much greater
                  resistance to theft.<br />

                <h4><b>P2P</b></h4>
                <p>Peer-to-peer (<i>P2P</i>) refers to the decentralized interactions that happen between at least two parties in a highly
                  interconnected network. P2P participants deal directly with each other through a single mediation point.
                  <br />
                </p>

                <h4><b>Participant</b></h4>
                <p>An actor who can access the ledger: read records or add records to. <br />
                </p>

                <h4><b>Peer</b></h4>
                <p>An actor that shares responsibility for maintaining the identity and integrity of the ledger. <br />
                </p>

                <h4><b>Permissioned Ledger</b></h4>
                <p>A permissioned ledger is a ledger where actors must have permission to access the ledger. Permissioned ledgers may
                  have one or many owners. When a new record is added, the ledger’s integrity is checked by a limited consensus process.
                  This is carried out by trusted actors — government departments or banks, for example — which makes maintaining a
                  shared record much simpler that the consensus process used by unpermissioned ledgers. Permissioned block chains provide
                  highly-verifiable data sets because the consensus process creates a digital signature, which can be seen by all parties.
                  A permissioned ledger is usually faster than an unpermissioned ledger.<br />
                </p>

                <h4><b>Private Currency</b></h4>
                <p>A currency issued by a private individual or firm, typically secured against uninsured assets. <br />
                </p>

                <h4><b>Private Key</b></h4>
                <p>A private key is a string of data that shows you have access to bitcoins in a specific wallet. Private keys can be
                  thought of as a password; private keys must never be revealed to anyone but you, as they allow you to spend the bitcoins
                  from your bitcoin wallet through a cryptographic signature.<br />
                </p>

                <h4><b>Proof-of-Stake</b></h4>
                <p>An alternative to the proof-of-work system, in which your existing stake in a cryptocurrency (the amount of that currency
                  that you hold) is used to calculate the amount of that currency that you can mine.<br />
                </p>

                <h4><b>Proof-of-Work</b></h4>
                <p>A system that ties mining capability to computational power. Blocks must be hashed, which is in itself an easy computational
                  process, but an additional variable is added to the hashing process to make it more difficult. When a block is successfully
                  hashed, the hashing must have taken some time and computational effort. Thus, a hashed block is considered proof
                  of work.<br />

                  nodes and gateways operated by authorities. Payments are made using a series of IOUs, and the network is based on

It basically means applications  that are hosted by the vendor on the cloud and can be accessed by the users online for a subscription fee, as opposed to users buying the software outright in a hard format like a CD.</p>

                <h4><b>Scrypt</b></h4>
                <p>An alternative proof of work system to SHA-256, designed to be particularly friendly to CPU and GPU miners, while offering

                  ledger is to allow anyone to contribute data to the ledger and for everyone in possession of the ledger to have identical
                  copies. This creates censorship resistance, which means that no actor can prevent a transaction from being added
